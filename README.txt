NAIB - Not Another IRC Bot

The name will change when I discover a better name.

To use ˙callang, silly esolang I chose to start
implementing instead of a proper calc for the bot,
get the callang file from my gochunks repo.
Alternatively you could also just comment-out or
delete the few lines that are relevant to it.


This software comes with absolutely no warranty, and
you are entitled to use it in any manner you deem fit.

If you like it or find it somehow useful, feel free
to treat me a drink or something nice to smoke.
